# cmsc420_btree
This is a project I worked on for my CMSC420 class in which I created a B-tree data structure in python. I worked specifically on the b.py file which includes the 
B-tree's main methods insert, delete, trace_from_file, trace_to_file, and other supporting methods such as left_rotation, right_rotation, split, load_tree, dump_tree.
The test.by file was a file provided by my professor to test our B-tree code and I was able to pass all of the tests in that file.
